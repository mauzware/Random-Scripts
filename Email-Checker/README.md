# **Email Checker**

## **email_checker.py**

usage: python3 email_checker.py <email list>

EVERYTHING IS HARD CODED INSIDE THE CODE:

change url -> login page you are checking emails for<br>
change password -> to anything literally<br>
error message -> put error message that appears on login page when you put invalid email<br>

you will need a email list to check from it:
